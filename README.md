## BookCars

BookCars is an open-source and cross-platform car rental platform with an admin panel for managing fleets and bookings, as well as a frontend and a mobile app for renting cars.

It comes with built-in support for Stripe and PayPal payment gateways, allowing you to choose the one best suited for your country or business model. If Stripe isn't available in your region, PayPal serves as a secure and reliable alternative.

BookCars supports both single-supplier and multi-supplier modes. Suppliers can manage their fleets and bookings through a dedicated admin panel. Each new supplier receives an email prompting them to create their account and gain access to the system.

The admin panel allows admins to manage suppliers, cars, countries, locations, parking spots, customers, bookings, and payments.

Customers can register through the web frontend or mobile app, search for available cars based on pickup and drop-off points and time, choose a car and complete the checkout process in a few clicks.
